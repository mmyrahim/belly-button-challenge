this project is an interactive web dashboard to visualize the belly button biodiversity dataset. it's designed to present the analysis of microbial species also called operational taxonomic units, or otus found in people's navels.

key features:

an interactive dropdown menu to select and view data for specific individual test subjects.
a horizontal bar chart showcasing the top 10 otus found in the selected individual.
a bubble chart representing each sample where marker size and color vary based on the sample values and otu ids.
a display panel presenting the selected individual's demographic information.


this project was by far the most challenging one i've undertaken, if it weren't for the following resources and templates i could not have done it:

https://plotly.com/javascript/bubble-charts/ to help with bubble chart
